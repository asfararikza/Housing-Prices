# Housing Prices Prediction with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a simple neural network model built with TensorFlow to predict housing prices based on the number of bedrooms. The model is designed to learn a straightforward relationship where each additional bedroom adds a fixed cost to the base price of a house.

## Project Introduction
In this project, we aim to create a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula:
- A house has a base cost of 50k.
- Every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k.

Using this formula:
- A 1-bedroom house costs 100k.
- A 2-bedroom house costs 150k.
- A 7-bedroom house should cost close to 400k.
  
The goal is to train a neural network that learns this relationship and accurately predicts the prices of houses with different numbers of bedrooms.
